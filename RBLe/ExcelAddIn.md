# KAT Tools Excel Add-in

KAT has developed an Excel add-in (KAT.Extensibility.Excel.xll) to help KAT developers in many of the day to day tasks when creating Employee Self Service or Administration websites in the Evolution and/or Camelot frameworks. The add-in's functionality has now expanded to cover all areas of CalcEngine management, Specification Sheet management, export data into a format that can be consumed by KAT's XML Data Service (xDS), as well as general purpose Excel spreadsheet helpers.

The original documentation (and it will continue to be updated) was leveraging 'comments' on Excel cells of the add in. However, this required a user to know which cells to examine, along with not allowing the user to do an easy search of the entire set of documentation. Although it would be beneficial to read all the documentation for RBLe Framework in its entirety, time permitting, KAT intended this document to be an online searchable document so that when questions arise about specific functionality in regards to CEs, Spec Sheets, and/or exporting data the user can search this document instead of being forced to find the 'hidden' comment on an Excel cell.
