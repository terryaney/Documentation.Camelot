# RBLe Framework

The RBLe Framework is the backbone of the products that the KAT team creates: sites, KatApps, document packages, etc.  The service is able to marshall inputs and results in and out of RBLe CalcEngines used to perform the complex actuarial calculations, HR business logic, etc.

There are several topics to cover to get a full understanding of how to leverage the RBLe Framework.

- [RBLe CalcEngines](CalcEngines.md) - Discusses structure and features provided by RBLe CalcEngines.
- [Function Documentation](#function-documentation) - Provides a list of all the replacement functions provided by the RBLe framework.
- [KAT Tools Excel Add-in](ExcelAddIn.md) - Learn how to use the KAT Tools Excel Add-in to leverage RBLe replacment functions, RBLe Macro language, general Excel spreadsheet utilities, xDS data exporting and more.
- [Evolution Framework Result Builder](Evolution.ResultBuilder.md) - Discusses how to use the Evolution Framework Result Builder to create complete html results directly from RBLe Calculation results.
